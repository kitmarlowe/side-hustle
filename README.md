# Learning Side Hustle: Exploring React.js with TypeScript and Vite

## Introduction
Welcome to my Learning Side Hustle project! In this module, I've chosen to dive into React.js, an essential technology in modern web development. My goal is to gain proficiency in React.js while also exploring TypeScript and Vite as additional tools for enhancing my development workflow.

## Choice of Technology
I've selected React.js for my side hustle project because I've been eager to learn about it. Although I was initially oblivious to anything about React.js, I saw this as an opportunity to challenge myself and expand my skill set in web development.

## Learning Resources
To kickstart my journey, I've decided to follow the "React tutorial for beginners" video series by Programming with Mosh on YouTube. I've previously used this YouTuber's tutorials for JavaScript and found them highly beneficial. As of now, I've learned how to set up the learning environment by downloading the latest version of Node.js and configuring it through the command line.

## Project Components
- **React.js:** I'll be delving into the fundamentals of React.js, learning about components, state management, and more.
- **TypeScript:** I'm excited to explore TypeScript, a statically typed superset of JavaScript, which will enhance type safety and code quality within my React.js project.
- **Vite:** I'll be utilizing Vite as the development server to streamline the application development process, taking advantage of its fast build times and modern features.

## Next Steps
1. Continue following the tutorial series to gain a comprehensive understanding of React.js concepts and best practices.
2. Implement TypeScript integration into the project and explore its benefits in enhancing code maintainability and scalability.
3. Utilize Vite as the development environment to build and iterate upon the React.js application, incorporating learned concepts and features.

## Weekly Status Reports
As part of the requirements for this module, I'll be submitting weekly status reports on my progress. These reports will include examples of my work, video demonstrations, and insights gained throughout the learning process.

Stay tuned for updates on my journey into React.js with TypeScript and Vite!
