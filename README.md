# React To-Do List App Presentation

## Slide 1: Introduction

### Welcome to the React To-Do List App
This presentation will walk you through the key components and techniques used in this React application.

## Slide 2: Overview

### App Overview
- A simple To-Do List application.
- Allows users to add, edit, and delete tasks.
- Persists tasks using local storage.

## Slide 3: Features

### Key Features
- **Add New Tasks**: Users can add new tasks to the list.
- **Edit Tasks**: Users can edit existing tasks.
- **Cancel Editing**: Users can cancel the editing process.
- **Save Edited Tasks**: Users can save changes made to tasks.
- **Delete Tasks**: Users can delete tasks from the list.
- **Persist Data**: Tasks are stored in local storage to persist data across sessions.

## Slide 4: State Management

### Managing State in React
- **useState Hook**: Used to manage state variables.
  - `tasks`: An array that stores the list of tasks.
  - `task`: A string that stores the current input task.

### Why use useState?
- It allows components to have local state.
- React re-renders the component whenever the state changes, ensuring the UI stays up-to-date.

## Slide 5: useEffect Hooks

### Using useEffect for Side Effects
- **Loading Tasks**: Load tasks from local storage when the component mounts.
- **Saving Tasks**: Save tasks to local storage whenever the `tasks` state changes.

### Why use useEffect?
- It handles side effects in functional components.
- It runs after every render by default but can be configured to run only when specific state variables change.

## Slide 6: Adding a Task

### Adding a New Task
- **addTask Function**: Handles the submission of the form to add a new task.
  - Prevents the default form submission behavior.
  - Adds the new task to the `tasks` array.
  - Resets the input field.

### Key Points
- Ensures tasks are not empty before adding them.
- Updates the state to reflect the new list of tasks.

## Slide 7: Editing a Task

### Editing an Existing Task
- **editTask Function**: Updates the text of an existing task based on its ID.
  - Finds the task to be edited.
  - Updates the task's text.

### Key Points
- Uses array mapping to create a new state array with the updated task.
- Ensures immutability by creating a new array instead of modifying the existing state directly.

## Slide 8: Managing Edit State

### Managing Edit State
- **startEditing Function**: Enables editing mode for a task.
- **saveEdit Function**: Saves the edited task.
- **cancelEdit Function**: Cancels the editing mode.

### Key Points
- Each task has an `isEditing` property to determine if it's in edit mode.
- Functions update this property to control the UI's state.

## Slide 9: Deleting a Task

### Deleting a Task
- **deleteTask Function**: Removes a task from the `tasks` array based on its ID.
  - Filters out the task to be deleted.

### Key Points
- Uses array filtering to create a new state array without the deleted task.
- Ensures immutability by creating a new array.

## Slide 10: JSX Structure

### Rendering the UI
- **Form**: Contains an input field and a button for adding new tasks.
- **Task List**: Renders each task with options to edit, save, cancel, or delete.

### Key Points
- Conditional rendering based on `isEditing` state.
- Separate UI elements for editing and displaying tasks.

## Slide 11: Styling with CSS

### CSS Styling
- **General Styles**: Body and app layout.
- **Input and Button Styles**: Consistent padding, border radius, font size, and shadows.
- **Task List Styles**: Flexbox layout for list items, shadows for depth.
- **Edit Form Styles**: Flexbox layout with gap for buttons.

### Key Points
- Uses Flexbox for layout management.
- Adds visual enhancements like shadows and rounded corners for a modern look.

## Slide 12: Conclusion

### Summary
- Demonstrates core React concepts: state management, hooks, and event handling.
- Uses local storage to persist data across sessions.
- Detailed CSS styling creates a user-friendly and visually appealing interface.
